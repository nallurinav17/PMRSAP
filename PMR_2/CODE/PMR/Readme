SAP PMR V1 Bug fixes.


version: Phase 2 SAP PMR NBI : 18 June 2014
Feature additions:
manual-nbiPmDataTx.sh	= Utility to synchronize the PM data manually with the NBI servers.
nbiPmDataTx.sh		= Utility to send PMR data to the NBI sources.
sshpass			= Compiled binary from the pelican build, tested for cherry as well to be used with nbiPmDataTx.sh
Since the login is required to be password based, we had to include sshpass and utilize the --rsh parameter for rsync to work over the ssh protocol with password as environment variable SSHPASS. We needed to put -R option for rsync to enable creation of directory structure at remote destination.
(Sample: /usr/bin/rsync -avzrR '--rsh=/data/scripts/PMR/bin/sshpass -e ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l root' /data/mgmt/pmr/data/pm/./VISP/SMLAB/2014/07/09 10.10.21.67:/tmp/nbi/ )
