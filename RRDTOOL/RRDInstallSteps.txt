Hi Bruno,

I have completed the html table generation of the PM Traffic Report. Please find the html attached (PMR_Report_20140417.html)

1]  records/sec is currently blank and I need clarification for this. (as reported in my previous mail)
2] Processing Time will have proper values/Format once we have the actual data trickling in.
3] Table creation is triggered from cron:
# Run the script to generate the HTML Table report on a daily basis using RRD
15 10 * * *      root    /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD/bin/tableCreate.sh 2>&1 > /tmp/tableCreate.log

4] Sample date Result path:
/data/mgmt/pmr/reports/SAP/2014/04/PMR_Report_20140417.html

5] Also attaching the source PMR_RRD.tar.gz. This will be version 1.0.


I will be on vacation from 18 to 29 Apr. Will respond to mail from 29Apr.


Thanks,
Anil

Hi Supreet,

Please find attached scripts  for report automation.

Install Steps on Master (SAP).

1] install rrdtool and htmldoc (also install fonts )

2] cp PMR_RRD.tar.gz /tmp/ on Master

3] tar -zxvhf PMR_RRD.tar.gz

4] mkdir -p /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD

5] cp -r /tmp/PMR_RRD/* /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD/

6] Create RRD schema for the first time
./bin/createSchema.sh 
Do you really want to create RRD schema (Y/N)? This will overwrite previous RRD files. 

<Type Y> to proceed

7] Add cron bin/PMR_RRD.cron

8] Ensure the configs are pointed to correct .prod or .smlab file. 



The configs need minimal change:
etc/PMRrrdConfig.prod:

PMRHOST1, PMRHOST2 , PMRMASTER


Info:

- Runs on SAP master (check in place)

- Cron:

# Run the script to populate RRD files with current SAP PM metrics data
10 9 * * *      root    /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD/bin/rrdUpdate.sh 2>&1 > /tmp/rrdUpdate.log

# Run the script to generate png images of counters with site pairs from RRD
30 9 * * *      root    /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD/bin/graphCreate.sh 2>&1 > /tmp/graphCreate.log

# Run the script to generate the PDF report on a daily basis from the png graphs 
00 10 * * *      root    /data/scripts/PMR/PMR_RRD/bin/htmldocCreate.sh 2>&1 > /tmp/htmldocCreate.log


- Result PDF path is configured as: PDFRESULTPATH="/data/mgmt/pmr/reports/SAP"


Please checkin to git and let me know if you have any questions.
